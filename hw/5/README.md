1) What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
  All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic.  
  Position, Shape, Size, Color, Line Width, Line Type  
  
2) Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
  Those that can represent continuous data and those that can not.  
    
3) Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
  Continuous- quantitative/numerical continuous. Arbitrary Numerical Values  
  Discrete- quantitative/categorical ordered. Good, Fair, Poor  
  
4) What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
Factors and the different categories are called levels.  
  
5) Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
  Ordered- Quantitative, Numerical, size, color, width, area  
  Unordered- Qualitative, Categorical, shape, color, style,  
  Both- size, color, width, area, Qualitative, Categorical  
  
6) What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
  Quantitative/Qualitative? Quantitive  
  Numerical/Categorical? Numerical  
  Continuous/Discrete? Discrete  
  Ordered/Unordered? Ordered

7) What kinds of axes in a plot should be represented with the same units and grid size?  
  Coordinate System - when data needs to be compared or on an even scale to represent relativity. It is a good practice.  
  
8) Describe an example scenario in which transforming the axes of the plot results in better visualizations.  
  Especially good when having Skewed DATA or non-linear as the outliers can alter the data in a misleading way and that needs to be recognized.  
  
9) Which one of the following three coordinates are valid and can be used to represent data?  
  All can be used to represent data dependent on the audience and its knowledge and the data. Usually, we only want to use the black grid as it is the most basic for all views and you can show all types of relevance whether that is with dots, linear, not linear, exponential, etcâ€¦
