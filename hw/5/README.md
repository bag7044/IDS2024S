What are aesthetics in data visualization? Name a few aesthetics that can appear in a data visualization.  
All data visualizations map data values into quantifiable features of the resulting graphic.  
Position, Shape, Size, Color, Line Width, Line Type  
  
Name the two major classes of aesthetics.  
Those that can represent continuous data and those that can not.  
    
Name the two major types of data and provide an example for each category.  
Continuous- quantitative/numerical continuous. Arbitrary Numerical Values  
Discrete- quantitative/categorical ordered. Good, Fair, Poor  
  
What is the common name for variables holding qualitative data?  
Factors and the different categories are called levels.  
  
Provide examples of ordered and unordered data.  
Ordered- Quantitative, Numerical, size, color, width, area  
Unordered- Qualitative, Categorical, shape, color, style,  
Both- size, color, width, area, Qualitative, Categorical  
  
What are the types of data in the columns of the following table?  
Quantitative/Qualitative? Quantitive  
Numerical/Categorical? Numerical  
Continuous/Discrete? Discrete  
Ordered/Unordered? Ordered
