![FinishedProgLangChart](FinishedprogLangChartPuzzle.pdf)  Not sure why not working, first started with adding it to my home and now am just leaving it in HW/2 repository.  
  1.2) Fortran, Algol 58, Lisp, Cobol, Basic,    C,   sh,  C++, Fortran 90, Python, Java, JavaScript,   C#.    
    1.3)  1950,     1950, 1950,  1950,  1960, 1970, 1970, 1980,       1990,   1990, 1990,       1990, 2000.  
2) Electronical Numerical Integrator and Computer
3) You can not have a percentage of an electrical current, all signals in a computer are on/charge (1) or off/no-charge (0). This is the building block of coding and all computer dialog.  
4) CPU- Central Processing Unit  
5) Disk which is usually a SSD or HDD.  
6) A bit.  
7a) Assembly Language  
  7b) It needs to be translated into machine code before being put in. It was more for humans to understand more easily to not lose track.  
8a) Fortran  
  8b) It was created in the 1950s aka 7 decades old.  
9a) This would be the Assembly generation.  
  9b) Fortran / 3rd gen, C / 3rd gen, C++ / 3rd gen, MATLAB / 4th gen, Python / 4th gen, and R / 4th gen   
10) C 1970s, C++ 1980s, MATLAB 1970s, Python 1990s, R 1990s  
11) B  
12) C with Classes  
13) APL for MATLAB and ABC for Python  
14) The registers which are above the CPU L# cache. Unless we are talking about the physical hardware you buy it is the RAM.
15) The registers which are above the CPU L# cache.  
16) About 100 ns faster.   
17) About a 1000 times faster.  
18) About 1,000,000 times faster.  
19) The more transistors, the more quickly a computer as it can do multiple things at once. We usually see them on CPUs and memory but they are used on all circuits to move electricity.  
20) Transistors are already at their smallest to where we see electrons moving out of their circuits. Meaning we can not make them smaller so we are making more cores in CPUs.
21) Fetch, Decode, and Execute.  
22) DRAM is now the limiting factor as CPUs are way more quick and focus developed over time.  
23) Yes, because it could have less/slower/older RAM which will bottleneck your CPU's full capacity.  
24)  
Dennard Scaling says as transistors shrink we are able to increase how many we put on a chip without consuming more power per transistor.  
MOSFET Scaling says shrinking the MOSFET will improve performance which correlates with  Dennard Scaling.  
Moore's Law which is more different says on average every two years the number of microchips doubles which doubles power and performance.  
25)   
1. 64 
2. 2080  
3. It would be about 1/3 of a pound.   
26)  
1.  9,223,372,036,854,775,808  
2. 18,446,744,073,709,551,615  
3. 376,462,736,402,031  
4. About one and a half years of world rice production.  
27) finite control, one tape/having memory which it can pull and push from, and moving read/write head  
28) Power law is constant as the exponent in is constant whereas as in exponential the exponent is what changes.
EX: Power Law y=x^a  /  Exponential y=a^x   a is the constant and x changes.
