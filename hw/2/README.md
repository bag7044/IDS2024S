2) Electronical Numerical Integrator and Computer
3) You can not have a percentage of an electrical current, all signals in a computer are on/charge (1) or off/no-charge (0). This is the building block of coding and all computer dialog.  
4) CPU- Central Processing Unit  
5) Disk which is usually a SSD or HDD.  
6) A bit.  
7a) Assembly Language  
  7b) It needs to be translated into machine code before being put in. It was more for humans to understand more easily to not lose track.  
8a) Fortran  
  8b) It was created in the 1950s aka 7 decades old.  
9a) This would be the Assembly generation.  
  9b) Fortran / 3rd gen, C / 3rd gen, C++ / 3rd gen, MATLAB / 4th gen, Python / 4th gen, and R / 4th gen
