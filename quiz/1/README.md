1)  
2) make directory,  
3) No, you have to add a README.md for the file and save the changes it is not like Google Docs.  
4) Not every folder has a .git folder, as they can be saved to only your computer if you like.  
5) The purpose of having a .git folder is to share and save your projects to the git DVCS.  
6) It will send you to the home file.  
7) Show all listed files.  
8) Show the current directory.
9) We first have the modified stage where you are still working, then the stage for committing to the repository by adding the file to .git, and last once you commit the project to the repository/push.
10) VCS- The version control system was the first Local VCS where you could track your own work only and if you lost it, it was gone.  
11)  
  + Had the VCS components  
  + Had the CVCS components  
  + You could share your work with other  
  + It was not local or distributed meaning that the chance of your files getting corrupt is on you instead of luck/ backup  
  + Now people can share codes worldwide which strengthens the knowledge of coding  
  + You can put certain claims on your projects  
  + can get or push coding from the DVCS  
12)  
  + VCS  
  + CVCS  
  + DVCS  
13) Git is more of a DVCS but with the use of GitHub you can push and pull files to the internet making it a DVCS. Once you commit and push the project it will be submitted to the Hub/ GitHub.  
14) It will show the listed files affected with added/modified/deleted information. With this you can also see the progress and if you need to save your file to commit.  
15) Git --push all will push all your files to the Git Hub including deleted ones, it will literally push all your files to the DVCS.  
16) Git pull will pull coding from the DVCS if you want to use it in your own projects.  Also if you want to get your own projects you can pull them into your coding console.  
17)  *A way to style your text and other things like images on the web for GitHub.*  
18)  **I will use two astric stars on each side of the text.**  
19)  *I had done it above for an example using one astric star on each side*  
20) git init or init init <name>
21) A singular. will take you back a folder and two .. will take you back two folders. A quicker way to travel around/ exit folders.
