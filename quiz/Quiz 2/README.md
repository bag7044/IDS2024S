1. Out of the drives it would be a DRAM which is faster than an SSD or HDD but on the triangle hierarchy it is the Registers above the L# cahses.   
2. Usually with larger loads of memory it is slower but with smaller loads of memory prefetching and fetching of the memory is quicker.  
3. That would be the HDD which is a disk and usually holds the most storage for the cheapest price point.  
4. Samllest to larget would be Registers > Cache(smaller the cache number the faster for 1 is faster than 2) > DRAM > Disk  
5. This would be a bit which is the singular 1 or 0 used in coding.  
6. 0 for no electricity signal and 1 for an electrical signal. on/off  
7. Under a nanosecond.  
8. The first programable computer was ENIAC built in the 1940s.  
9. 1940s  
10. A computer that only has one purpose like a calculator or ATM  
11. ATM or TI-30XS/TI-84/calculator
12. Declarative knowledge involves statements or facts while imperative knowledge is how to accomplish something like instructions.
