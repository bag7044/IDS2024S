1. Out of the drives it would be a DRAM which is faster than an SSD or HDD but on the triangle hierarchy it is the Registers above the L# cahses.   
2. Usually with larger loads of memory it is slower but with smaller loads of memory prefetching and fetching of the memory is quicker.  
3. That would be the HDD which is a disk and usually holds the most storage for the cheapest price point.  
4. Samllest to larget would be Registers > Cache(smaller the cache number the faster for 1 is faster than 2) > DRAM > Disk  
5. This would be a bit which is the singular 1 or 0 used in coding.  
6. 0 for no electricity signal and 1 for an electrical signal. on/off  
7. Under a nanosecond.  
8. The first programable computer was ENIAC built in the 1940s.  
9. 1940s  
10. A computer that only has one purpose like a calculator or ATM  
11. ATM or TI-30XS/TI-84/calculator
12. Declarative knowledge involves statements or facts while imperative knowledge is how to accomplish something like instructions.   
13a. declarative  
13b. declarative  
13c. imperative  
13e. imperative  
13d. declarative  
14. 3+  
15. ENIAC  
16. Python  
17. Plasma  
18. Input peripherals, CPU, output peripherals, main memory RAM, storage peripherals (SSD/HDD)
19. Calculator/ATM   
20. Fortran, COBOL, B, C++, Python, Java  
21.
a. We can read Binary but the closest would be Assembly.  
b. Yes
22.  
a. FORTRAN
b. Was made in the 1950s so 7 decades old.  
23.  
a. Assembly  
b. Fortran is 3rd, C is 3rd, C++ is 3rd, MATLAB is 4th, Python is 4th, R is 4th  
24. C 1970s, C++ 1980s, MATLAB 1970s, Python 1990s, R 1990s  
25. B  
26. C with classes
27.  APL for MATLAB and ABC for Python  
28.  a reading of numbers 
29. 3, each time the number increases it increases by 3. Also 99/33=3 besides the fact if you subtract the a number from its previous you get 3.  
30. HDD is longer lasting and they last about 8 years but you will see warranties for 2 years. I had an HDD go bad in 5 years which was tragic due to it being 1TB.  It would last as long as the magnets last.
31. A time teller. Although not electrical we see the use of time-telling dates back to the ancient Mayans who had a very specific calender almost identical to ours. It is in fact so close we are both is the error region of the calendar (modern and aztec) meaning their calender from 100s to 1000s of years ago could be more accurate.  
32. 10^n+1. N is the previous number so to get to 10^2 we add 1 + 1 which is the current n and so on.
